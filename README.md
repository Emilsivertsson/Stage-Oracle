## Description
This is the backend for the Stage Oracle project. It contains two API:s that are used for the project./n
The Registration API is used for Performers to register their data and manage it./n
the Production API is used for the production team to manage the production data and import performers into it.
Each of the API:s have their own My-SQL database and their own security solution issuing JWT tokens to users.


## What was your motivation?
This is a part of my degree project for the course "Java integration" at Campus MÃ¶lndal.
The project as whole is for Opera/theaters to manage their productions and performers.
